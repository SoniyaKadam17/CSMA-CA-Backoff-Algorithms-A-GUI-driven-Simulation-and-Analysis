**Overview**
The role of the backoff mechanism in Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocols is critical in managing network contention and optimizing channel access. 
This project explores the intricacies of the backoff mechanism and its impact on contention window size within CSMA/CA networks.
Through the development of a graphical user interface (GUI) on the Google Colab platform using Python, simulations of CSMA/CA and Hidden Node scenarios are conducted, incorporating various backoff algorithms to determine specific use cases. 
The study delves into three distinct backoff algorithms: Binary Exponential Backoff (BEB), Exponential Increase Exponential Decrease (EIED), and Logarithmic Increment Backoff. 
By simulating these algorithms within the context of CSMA/CA networks, this project provides insights into their effectiveness, adaptability, and overall influence on network performance.
Through comprehensive analysis, the project aims to enhance understanding of backoff mechanisms in CSMA/CA protocols and their implications for network efficiency and reliability.
